### Course Overview

Explore how to how to build and train the two most versatile and ubiquitous types of deep learning models in TensorFlow.

### Objectives
* recognize linear regression problems and extend that to general machine learning problems
* recognize how model parameter training happens via gradient descent to find minimum loss
* load a dataset and explore its features and labels
* choose the right form of data to feed into the linear regression model
* build a base model for comparison with scikit-learn
* create placeholders, training variables, and instantiate optimizers to use with regression
* train model parameters using a session and the training dataset, and visualize the result with Matplotlib
* demonstrate how to interpret the loss and summaries on TensorBoard
* choose the high-level Estimator API for common use cases
* train a regression model using the high-level Estimator API
* evaluate and predict housing prices using estimators
* identify classification problems and recall logistic regression for classification
* recognize cross entropy as the loss function for classification problems and use softmax for n-category classification
* identify data as being a continuous range or comprised of categorical values
* work with training and test data to predict heart disease
* train the high-level estimator for classification and use it for prediction
* describe basic concepts of the linear regression machine learning model
* describe basic concepts of the binary classification machine learning model
